"This project is part of my CodeAlpha Data Analytics internship. It involves web scraping quotes and authors from a sample website using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests."
# CodeAlpha_WebScraping

##Project Overview
This project demonstrates Web Scraping using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.
The script scrapes quotes and their authors from the website quotes.toscrape.com
 and saves the extracted data into a CSV file for further analysis.


 ##Features 
Extracts quotes and authors from the website.
Handles multiple pages (pagination) dynamically.
Saves data in a structured CSV file.
Can be used for data analysis or NLP projects.


##Tech Stack
Python 3
Requests – for making HTTP requests
BeautifulSoup – for HTML parsing
Pandas – for data storage and processing
